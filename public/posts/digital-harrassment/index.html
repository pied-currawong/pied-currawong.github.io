<p>Hello!</p>
<h2 id="the-limitations-of-current-safety-strategies">The Limitations of Current Safety Strategies</h2>
<p>The problem is that most strategies [example 1] to protect women from experiencing digital violence usually refers to actions an individual woman can take to stop abuse from happening to her - adding additional layers of security to their accounts, changing numbers, locking down social media accounts (or deleting them entirely). This victim-focused approach, whilst I understand it to be somewhat unavoidable at the moment, is problematic on quite a few fronts:</p>
<p>One, it puts the responsibility of abuse on women, and ultimately framing any violence against them as something that they should have avoided. This, of course, ignores the behaviour of men, the cultural perpetuation of traditional masculine gender roles and idealised hegemonic masculinities, and the structural and institutional forces that ignore, affirm, or amplify violence against women.</p>
<p>Two, it limits women&rsquo;s access to public and private life. Whilst deleting all your social media accounts is safer than having them active, it is also isolating, disconnecting you from friends and family who use those sites as a mean of communication and expression of social life. This is especially relevant for rural and regional women, whose geographic isolation can make the connective nature of social media much more valuable. Furthermore, a woman who uses Instagram to promote a small business, or uses Twitter in a professional capacity, has significant financial and career costs to making their account private or limiting those who can contact them. Even if they remain public profiles, putting the onus on a woman to document, report, and block the abuse they recieve adds ongoing labour to their continued existence in digital life, an emotional cost that sits alongside experiencing the abuse itself.</p>
<p>Whilst these current strategies for women safety online are problematic, as I mentioned earlier, it&rsquo;s a difficult problem to tackle. Digital violence is a bigger problem than the technology itself, a extension of offline attitudes and cultures of misogyny. New features will help, but they will struggle to combat the structural inequalities of broader society, of which digital platforms actively support and exacerbate. Technology is not neutral and acts as a significant structural force . When we talk about the need for structural change to prevent violence against women, we usually refer to fundamental shifts in policy, law, and cultural institutions. We must not forget that changes in the way we construct technological infrastructure for our online sociality is also necessary.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructures-of-harm">Infrastructures of Harm</h2>
<p>Salter&rsquo;s article in Digital Intimate Publics | digital coervice control article | TFCC article | Mediating Misgongy
The phrase of &ldquo;code is law&rdquo; is pertitent here, which, in short, is the idea that the programming of software regulates our online life, in the same way laws do in offline society. Critically, Lessig argues that code as a structural regulator is an unavoidable implementation of values, either deliberately or through omission.
danah boyd&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;networked publics&rdquo; extends this towards our social lives online. [network public definition]. boyd argues that online behaviour is shaped by the way technology &ldquo;configures digital environments&rdquo; where these interactions occur. She particularly makes a point of the power of &ldquo;bits&rdquo; – the building blocks of computing – which shape the way that technology does this structural configuring. The fundamental properties of computers matter in shaping our social lives, and so do the way we apply them.
In the context of social networks, boyd outlines four specific properties of computing that are influential in the way social media networks and their networked publics are configured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Persistence: Online expressions are automatically recorded and archived.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Replicability: Content made out of bits can be duplicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Scalability: The potential visibility of content in networked publics is great.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Searchability: Content in networked publics can be accessed through search.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no escaping the fact that these properties are not just advantageous to digital abusers, but the core tools and means of digital violence. As Tarleton Gillespie writes in Mediating Misogyny (p. 395):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has become clear that harassment is not an aberration, but a condition, of social media. This is in part because it takes the same shape as the best kinds of participation. In the fever dreams of their founders, these platforms were intended to allow everyone to speak their minds, to connect with others around issues that matter to them, to be findable on the network, to present themselves as they choose, and to form bonds through conversation untrammeled by status or location. Harassment is all of those things, at least for the harasser. Harassment is not a perversion of that dream; it is one logical version of that participation – just not the one designers had in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gillespie speaks of modern digital platforms, but to an extent it&rsquo;s turtles all the way down. Turning computers into communication tools is not a politically neutral decision. The very concept of computational communication technologies is at least partially embedded in the liberatian, techno-utopian political project of hackers being the harbingers of a world where ultimate individual freedom of expression ruled.
However, I resist categorising technology as a done deal. The core structural problem with the current crop of social media platforms is not that we are communicating through digital technologies: it&rsquo;s that communication is mapped 1:1 to data transfer. Communication is data, and data is communication, at least as these platforms are concerned. Currently, the code of social media structures our digital lives to be necessarily expressed in terms compatible with the properties of data: persistence, replicability, scalability and searchability.</p>
<p>This probably first came because of its simplicity, but it&rsquo;s been kept that way because it is immensely profitable. Imbuing communication and social interaction with the properties of &lsquo;bits&rsquo; creates a steady stream of data from users that is rich, refined, accurate, and ready to be used to serve advertisements, all given for free. And I think these sites played a very active role in redefining what it means to be social, so that they can profit off it. Couldry and van Djick put it excellently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling an algorithmically defined online configuration “social” has been one of the smartest semantic moves in the history of media institutions. Online sociality increasingly serves as a proxy for social interaction, whereas, in fact, this “social” comes as an effect of a new dominant techno-economic materiality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As these authors point out, our online social lives are really just a collection of social activities that can be viably exploited as data. These sites didn&rsquo;t necessarily change social life, but rather change what we think of as social life.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Online sociality can be redefined, and it can be redefined in such a way that doesn&rsquo;t directly inherit properties of computing and carefully considers what communication infrastructures can do. Corporate social media companies have a strong investment in making sure our digital social lives are structured in a way that makes them datafiable. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.</p>
