>If you want to take control of your life or work towards some kind of sustainable change in the world, you need to harness the power of story - Tyson Yunkaporta, Sand Talk, p. 129

Technology is *really* hard to define. In day-to-day life we usually use technology as the internet, mobile phones, computer software - which I will categorise as "digital technology". But technology covers much more than that. In it's most simplistic definition, technology is something that helps us achieve a goal. Examples of technology can often be easier to define it: technology encompasses everything a spear or a boomerang, the discovery of fire, the wheel, the ship, gunpowder, the printing press - as well as the digital technologies I mentioned earlier.

An aside, before we go any further. I will keep the technology/society dichotomy here for simplicity's sake, because this article is about how we represent technology. We see technology and society as two different things, which is the crux of the point I'm making. However, I think this dichotomy is somewhat flawed and believe we need to really crack open technology as a category and integrate it entirely within an extended social world[^1]. I'll write about it soon.

When thinking about the relationship between technology and society, there's a really easy tendency to see technology as the main thing that changes society - something known as technological determinism. An example of this might be the idea that social media makes us depressed, that the invention of AI will bring about a utopia, that dating apps have created hookup culture, or that the internet has changed how we connect with each other. It's the view that technology drives progress, and Western societies often use technological innovations (ie: discovery of fire, the invention of the wheel, the birth of the printing press, the introduction of the internet) as key social innovations[^2].


But technology theorists (myself included) find this perspective not quite enough. It takes an over-simplistic view of technology and society, and we believe our relationship with technology is much more entwined. I go as far as to argue that there are no clean distinctions between technology and ourselves. Both humans and technologies exist out of their relationships to each other, constantly forming and re-forming relationships with technology. This is an ongoing, iterative process – a complex web of human and non-human influences that contributes to changing how we relate to each other. It is out of these relationships that come opportunities to change society.

How are these "opportunities to change society" created? Honestly, so many ways. That's what the whole field of Internet Studies and Technology Studies is about. But I'm going to focus on one here: the idea that technology is tied up in how we make meaning as a society. I think artist James Bridle puts it very nicely: "Technologies are stories we tell ourselves – often unconsciously – about who we are and what we are capable of.” However, I want to emphasise that technology is not just the story we tell about ourselves, it is a *storyteller with us*. A gun gives us to opportunity to tell a violent story of conflict resolution, but until we make the gun, load it with a bullet, and pull the trigger, we haven't told that story.

My interest is in the politics of these collaborative stories: the politics that technology embodies, and thus the politics that are entwined with us. Because I do think technology is inherently political: to tell these stories, we need to make decisions about what is important, and the kind of society we want, and how we should achieve those aims. These decisions aren’t always deliberate, but they are deeply political decisions nonetheless. This process of decision-making is chaotic and deeply tangled, full of feedback loops. One decision we make about technology can cement a certain political idea into society such that it influences the very way we think about our next decison. Technology therefore becomes one way that we are constantly directing and redirecting each other, constraining and opening up new avenues for social life. For example, a dating app like Tinder came out of thousands of social, political, and technological changes, all feeding off each other. There isn't a single thread to track the invention of Tinder that isn't connected to hundreds of other threads.

Whilst I believe that politics permeates every aspect of our lives, I think the politics we co-create with technology is especially powerful because we are using these politics to tell a dominant story of social, economic, and political progress. Many other forms of politics seem to be somewhat resistant to change – the cogs of democracy turn very slowly indeed. But we've all agreed that technology can - and should - change the world as fast as it wants. Technology - particularly digital technology - is regularly framed as the solution to key social problems, at least for most of the West. Digital platforms and apps have dominated the past 15 years as the solution to almost every conceivable problem (for the white heterosexual middle class at least). Meanwhile, renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, artificial intelligence, and connecting everything to the internet are the solutions front of mind for our upcoming problems. Even as we rail against the negative effects of the certain technologies (eg. social media or the gig economy) we seem reluctant to abandon the promise of technological innovation. As long as we create social media *without* ads, or gig-economies *with better worker protections*, we'll be fine. When faced with a criticism of technology, the focus is immediately on problems with how technology works (ie: petrol cars; social media monopolies), either explicitly or implicitly positioning these problems as being solvable through better technology (electric cars, decentralised social media).

But I think we’re massively overstating the ability of digital technology to solve certain social problems. The point is not whether technology is good or bad – the point is that technology is a particular form of politics, and whatever this form of politics is[^3], it's a powerful politics of progress that we really believe in.

But it’s a politics of progress that I don't think is working for social justice. There’s no question about its power: our collaborative political story with technology reverberates through culture, business, economy, healthcare, education, social life, and domestic life. Even though our entwined relationship with technology is changing our social lives faster than democracy ever could, we still have deep social injustices. In fact, our relationships with technology are amplifying and normalising these injustices. That’s not even mentioning the costs our these entwined relationships have our mental health, the environment, and our relationships with each other. Technology cannot rescue society, because technology is *unavoidably part of society*. We are our technology.

For this reason, I think it's imperative that we understand the politics behind the stories of progress we tell with technology, and the values and ideals that underpin those stories. I can’t do that by myself, and I don’t really want to, for various reasons. But I will contribute in my small way by taking a subset of technology (digital technologies) and then a subset of that subset (unjust inequalities perpetuated by digital platforms). I think the harms and injustices that happen on digital platforms are visible markers of the boundaries the values and ideals we have embedded - and continue to embed - in digital platforms. Identifying these boundaries helps us define and understand the complexities and subtleties of the political story of progress we are co-creating with technology. If we can understand begin to understand how we envision the future with technology, we can work out why it’s not delivering on its promise. And then we can find a new way to envision ourselves and what we are capable of, because we need a better story about ourselves[^4].
Then we're going to tell that story.

[^1]:If you're new to these ideas, a good starting point is learning about Aboriginal and Indigenous spiritualities, as Indigenous peoples have been living these ideas for generations and often communicate it much more intuitively than Western Academia has managed so far.
[^2]:The idea of a society or culture being as complex as its material technology is problematic at best, and is a key means to which colonialism, white supremacy is enacted.
[^3]:I think it's pretty obviously neoliberalism, but I'm very interested in the story neoliberalism tells us through digital technologies, and what 'props up' that neoliberalism to make it the cultural mythos that it appears to be (ie: classical liberalism, technological determinism, capitalism, patriarchy, colonialism, white-supremacy...)
[^4]:I think it was Stan Grant who said "The only way to change politics is to change the people. And the only way to change the people is to tell a better story"

For instance, we might say that the internet prioritises an ideal of individual freedom (a conscious political decision), and is constructed and maintained in such a way that only tech-savvy, english-speaking white men have the full access to that freedom (an unconscious political decision). An example might be how the internet's initial pledge of individual freedom merged with the idea of free-market capitalism to produce today's neoliberal digital platforms.
